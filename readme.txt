~WHAT IS THIS?~~~~
What is this?! This is a firewall, for CMPUT 333's second assignment. Given two
unique clients (windows and a linux) I must manage the incoming and outgoing traffic.

Why? Because we cannot arbitrarily trust that the network will be safe. The firewall
is being put directly smack infront of the servers to act as a gate guardian to these
two clients. 




~MISC QUESTIONS~~~~

So this project may cause a lot of questions to arise...
I want to dispell these here!

#1: "What the hell is a .sh?"
This is going to be the file type for a shell script file.
Why a shell script file...? Because that is what I need to
run on the actual firewall itself. This is where I will be
putting into the firewall the actual rules it will abide!
